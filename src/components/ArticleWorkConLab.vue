      <label class="ftArti">Before reading this article, I suppose that you've already read
        <router-link style="color: #F2CC0E;" to="/about">Snowphfee and Coffee</router-link>,
        <br>another article that I explain why I wrote these introductions about coffee. Today we are
        <br>going to learn hand dripping, the best way I suggest to get into world of coffee.</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftSubtopic">Start learning hand drip coffee</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftArti">Hand dripping is the first brewing method I learned. Coffee is put in the filter paper on
        <br>the dripper, also called filter cone, after ground. Pouring hot water by swan neck kettle,
        <br>special kettles that allow us to pour thin spout under control. Coffee brewed by dripping
        <br>has clear flavor that is suitable to train our taste and easy to control factors that influence
        <br>the flavor of coffee. Being able to taste what flavor in the coffee is very important for one
        <br>who wants to learn coffee. Coffee, after all, is a kind of drinks that a good cup of coffee
        <br>means a delicious one. Knowing what lead to a worse flavor and how to make it better,
        <br>thus, become significant to brew coffee. As a result, the lucidness of hand drip coffee
        <br>allows it a fabulous method for coffee beginners.</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftSubtopic">How to drip a cup coffee</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftArti">To begin with, we should get familiar with the instruments of hand-drip coffee.</label>
      <img :src="artPic1" style="width: 810px;height: 540px;margin-left: 75px;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">

      <label class="ftArti"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Beans: whole beans that are not ground
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Grinder: we would grind coffee beans just before we drip, so a grinder is
        necessary.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Filter and filter paper: there are lots of design of filters, each has its
        benefits.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Coffee server: the pot that allows coffee to flow into.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Swan neck kettle: kettle that allow us to pour thin spout under control.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Electronic scale: to scale the weight of beans, which is an important factor.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Thermometer: to determine the temperature of water in the kettle.</label><br>

      <label class="ftArti">Samples of the instruments are in the picture above.
        <br>First of all, we scale the beans. The weight of beans depend on how mush coffee we
        <br>want to brew. The ratio of beans to coffee is often set as 11 to 15. Take 13 for example, it
        <br>means if we want to brew 300 ml coffee, we should use about 23 gram coffee beans.
        <br>Second, we set the filter on the coffee server, filter paper on the filter, Next, pour some
        <br>hot water on the filter paper. This warms the filter and the server, preventing hot coffee
        <br>cools down by them and at the same time allows the paper fits to the filter. Don't forget
        <br>to clear the server. Then, we prepare hot water in the kettle and determine the
        <br>temperature of water by the thermometer. The temperature of water is one of significant
        <br>factors that would affect flavors. Last, we grind our beans. After being ground, the flavor </label><br>

      <img :src="artPic1" style="width: 540px;height: 360px;float: right;margin-right: 480px;">

      <label class="ftArti">of beans start vanishing that we had
        <br>better not grind until we are to drip
        <br>them. As we prepare all things above,
        <br>we could start to drip.
        <br>Firstly, pour a little water to coffee
        <br>grounds, not too much. This allows
        <br>coffee grounds to absorb water and
        <br>emit carbon dioxide, called coffee
        <br>bloom. A good coffee bloom leads to
        <br>appropriate release of flavors and </label><br>

      <label class="ftArti">stabilize the following dripping process, vice versa. Until grounds slightly crack, we
        could
        <br>continue to pour water. Keep the spout thin and vertical, move slowly and spirally toward
        <br>the brim of grounds, but do NOT pour the brim. Only move close to the it because the
        <br>brim construct as a wall, preventing other grounds to fall. Go back spirally to middle and
        <br>repeat, until enough coffee we have in the coffee server at the bottom. Congratulations,
        <br>we can enjoy our hand-drip coffee! Never forget to warm the cup before using it to drink
        <br>the coffee. </label><br><br>

      <label class="ftSubtopic">Factors affect flavors</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftArti">There are plenty of factors that could lead to bad flavors. The irreplaceable factor is
        the
        <br>bean. Imagine a plate of steak, nothing would be more important than the steak itself
        <br>made from a good piece of meat, so do coffee. Good beans mean they were planted in
        <br>good condition of climate, such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Guatemala, Panama or so, and
        <br>roasted by experienced coffee roaster. If we learn more, roasting is also a part to skill in,
        <br>but now we focus on brewing. It is hard for us to brew delicious coffee from bad beans
        <br>that obtaining good ones is very important.
        <br>Aside from beans, what are factors that may influence the flavors? Grinders, temperature,
        <br>ratio of beans and coffee, size of grounds, water, dripping strategies, these are common
        <br>factors that have great influence on flavors of hand-drip coffee:
        <br>1. Grinder:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for beans, grinder is the most significant factor in my concern. Varied
        from
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 dollar to 3000 dollar, grinders produce different type of grounds. Each type
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results in different style and quality of flavors. However, as we start dripping
        coffee,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's hard for us to change our machine right away. Therefore, we could only
        consider
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this factor when buying a new grinder rather than control it while brewing.
        <br>2. <label style="color: #F22E1D">Temperature:</label>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature affects everywhere while brewing. Temperature of water in the
        kettle,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter, server, cups, surroundings, etc. We usually focus on water, as long as
        we
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warm those devices first and prevent using fans or air conditioners directly to
        them.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water in the kettle is one factor we could easily control to change the flavor.
        A
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colder degree like 85 to 87 degree Celsius often used to drip medium dark or
        dark
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roasted while 88 to 92 degree Celsius fit light roasted. There is no absolute
        degree
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each coffee that we should adjust it to cooperate with other factors.
        <br>3. <label style="color: #F22E1D">Ratio:</label>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of weight of beans and brewed coffee affect the flavor apparently that
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more beans to brew less coffee becomes denser than less beans to brew more
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coffee. However, we usually change other factor first, like temperature of water
        or
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size of grounds.
        <br>4. <label style="color: #F22E1D">Size of grounds:</label>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thinner size of grounds not only produces more flavor but also becomes more
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easily to over brew (produce too much things included bad flavors). To find
        suitable
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size of grounds cooperate with water temperature and ratio is a crucial lesson
        for
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every brewer.
        <br>5. Water:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerals in the water would influence flavors of coffee but hard for us to
        control.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why sometimes even though we use almost exactly same things like a
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professional coffee shop do but the coffee still taste different from what they
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served. According that we are not able to build costly water filter system at
        home,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we could simply use Brita or other filter and abandon to control this factor.
        <br>6. Dripping strategy
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many styles of dripping strategy. Some people like to bloom longer
        while
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some people decide to pour more water when spirally moving. All of them are
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuing better flavors of coffee. There is no absolutely best strategy but I
        would
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest a beginner to choose ONE strategy at first. Make one strategy stably
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perform every time and alter other factors like temperature, ratio, and grounds
        first.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many factor would lead to chaos and confusion to beginners.</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftSubtopic">Enjoy dripping coffee</label><br><br>

      <label class="ftArti">To sum up, I suggest beginners to choose one dripping strategy first and try to change
        <br>the highlighted factors. Our target is to find a nice setting for beans that brewed coffee
        <br>would not perform strange flavor and had better delicious to us. It would spend a lot of
        <br>time practicing and seeking the setting of factors but definitely a remarkable process.</label><br><br>
